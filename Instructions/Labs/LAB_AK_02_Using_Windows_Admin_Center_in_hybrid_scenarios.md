1. Within the console session to the **WSLabOnboard-DC** VM, in the browser displaying the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade displaying the Log Analytics workspace you were reviewing in the previous exercise.

1. On the Log Analytics workspace blade, in the **General** section, select **Logs**.
1. On the **Example queries** pane, scroll down to the **Virtual machines** section, select it, in the listing of queries, locate the **Missing security or critical updates** from the **Virtual Machine** tile, hover over the **Run** button, and select **Load to editor**.
1. In the editor window, remove the line '| summarize count() by Classification', select **Run** and review results of the query.

   >**Note**: the query lists all of missing security or critical updates.

1. In the editor window, replace the query with the following one:

   ```kql
   Update
   | where UpdateState == 'Needed' and Optional == false and Classification == 'Security Updates' and Approved != false and Computer hassuffix "corp.contoso.com" and Computer !contains "S2D"
   | distinct Computer
   ```

   >**Note**: Computer group queries must use the `distinct Computer` clause.

   >**Note**: The query excludes servers which are members of the Storage Spaces Direct cluster because these are updated by using Cluster Aware Updating.

1. Select **Run** to verify that the query returns the list of noncompliant servers in the `Corp.contoso.com` domain that are not part of the Storage Spaces Direct cluster.
1. Select **Save**; in the drop down list, select **Save**; in the **Save** pane, specify the following settings; and then select **Save**:
